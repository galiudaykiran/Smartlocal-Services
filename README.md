🌐 SmartLocal Services – Location-Based Multi-Service Aggregator
SmartLocal Services is a user-centric, location-aware platform that allows users to discover and book various local services—such as electricians, tutors, beauty experts, and more—based on their current or selected geographical location.

This project focuses on providing a smooth and connected front-end experience for service discovery, booking, and profile management—all without a backend server.



🎯 Project Objective
To build a fully functional front-end platform where users can navigate screen by screen, interact with service listings, simulate bookings, and manage their profiles—without using any backend services or databases. The application demonstrates feature connectivity, smooth navigation, and realistic user flows using mock data or front-end storage (like localStorage or context).
