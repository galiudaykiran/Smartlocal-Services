# 🌐 SmartLocal Services – Location-Based Multi-Service Aggregator (Frontend-Only)

SmartLocal Services is a **fully frontend-based platform** that allows users to discover and simulate the booking of local services—like electricians, beauty experts, tutors, and more—**based on geographical location**.

This project is built entirely on the frontend to demonstrate screen-to-screen navigation, UI/UX design, and feature connectivity **without any backend integration**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

To create a **user-friendly, screen-by-screen platform** that simulates a real-world service aggregator using mock data, local state, and front-end tools—showcasing how complete functionality and seamless flow can be achieved **without a backend**.
